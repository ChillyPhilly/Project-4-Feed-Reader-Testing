# Udacity Project 4 - Feed Reader Testing
This is a project for my Udacity course, for which we were provided the skeleton files and required to create tests to check the functionality of the page.

## How to Run the application
1. Application is run by opening index.html in the browser
2. Feeds will be displayed in the main Selection
3. Click on whichever article interests you!
4. To select other feeds, click the "Hamburger" (lol) icon in the top left
5. Scroll to bottom of page to check that tests all pass

### Dependencies
1. Jasmine-jQuery - https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery - `npm install jasmine-jquery`

###### All other dependencies are imported through web sources in index.html (and so don't need to be installed), however they are listed below for reference.
1. Jasmine - https://jasmine.github.io/
2. jQuery - https://jquery.com/
3. handlebars - https://handlebarsjs.com/
4. Google js API - http://google.com/jsapi
